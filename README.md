# WallpaperManager (WIP name)
A wallpaper manager with settings per image file.

## Why?
There doesn't seem to be any good wallpaper managers that support setting adjustments per image. This means that you either have to pre-crop them or have a poorly fitting image as your background image.

Additionally, none of them seem to support having different settings based on screen orientation, which makes finding a good group of wallpapers to cycle through hard for devices such as the Surface Pro.
